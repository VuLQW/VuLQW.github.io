  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)

  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

For the button on the loading page, I went with a solid drop shadow and used a color blending with the background so that an illusion is shown
where the drop shadow outlines the button than the button itself. When clicking the button the presses down and initiates the load throbber afterwards.
The load throbber is a circle which spins around to mock a loading animation. I did this to stray away from the generic horizontal progress bar. Moreover, I changed
the colour of the spinner which gives a little detail that the colour scheme of the site will be around the colour green which is represent through var(--col-03)
I changed the nav bar to become horizontal rather than vertical here the code worked in my favour since hanging the radius and margins automatically put the buttons
in that particuar fashion. I removed the numbers from the list so that it would be more simple and created a drop shadow upon hovering over the button. Pressing 
the button would fill in the button with the green colour which ould indicate that the user has pressed and intiated the button. The light and dark mode button is different
where hovering over the button would slide the color green across. This also inicates that the user needs to press the button where clicking on it will fill white text black.
I changed the top button making the box bigger for better visibility. Hovering over it will ease in the center of the button from black to green. Going into dark mode
will go from white to green. Clicking on that button will transiton the page to the top. For the general stylistic choice of the page, I went with a bold bubbly font
which I thought went well with the overall white creamish colour of the site. I centered the <h2> elements leaving the <h1> so it could align with the nav 
  bar which sat on the left as well. With the image with Hosono, I changed the radius, created a border as well putting the border as green to match the overarching
  colour scheme of the site as well.

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
