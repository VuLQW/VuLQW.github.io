<!--For this assingment I decided to use the fullscreen button as an for the video element. FOr the coding I implemented the toggle function so that the fullscreen
could be initiated on click. One of the difficulties were that the icon for the fullscreen was stuck to the left side of the control bar. I tried meddling around with float and other various
code that would bring the fullscreen element to the right but it didnt work. The simple solution that worked was to move the <button> that belonged to the fullscreen
element to the end after the proress bar as the <div> worked as a list. After I realised that the element was just a button so using some knowledge of the 
previous assignment, I decided to animate the hovering of the fullscreen button so the user knows that t is a button waiting to be clicked.
The animation eased into the centre of the button. I chose this animation as it show that by pressing onto the button the user is somewhat focussing on the content
which is followed by the fullscreen which focusses on the content by filling the whole screen with the video.  -->
