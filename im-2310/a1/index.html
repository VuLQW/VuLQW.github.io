            <h2> WEEK 1 QUESTIONS</h2>
            <ol><h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3></ol>
            <p>The first thing I paid attention to was the image of a man which I assumed was Max Bittker.</p>

            <ol><h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3></ol>
            <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p class="center-text"> <li>Entered the website </li>
                <li>Immediately looked at the image of what I assume to be Matt</li>

                <li>Held onto the mouse and guided the walking ear around.</li>
                <li>Kept dragging the ear away from all the content to see what happened. Nothing happened.</li>
                <li>Pressed back and returned to the 'More projects' page</li>
                <li>Pressed Max Bittker to return to the homepage.</li>
                <li>Continuously pressed on the dots on the little dots under specific sections to see what would happen.</li>
                <li>The circles and boxes were filled with grey when pressed but nothing happened.</li>
                <li>Noticed that there were boxes of 'x' on each section.</li>
                <li>Tried to remove all sections to see if there were any effects.</li>
                <li>Discovered a moving donut that was outside the border of the webpage.</li>
                <li>Continued to clear all sections and I was left with 5 lines around the whole page.</li>

                <li>Pressed the 'Send me a letter?' button.</li>

            <ol><h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3></ol>
            <p>I spent the most time engaging with the tools provided to draw in the ‘Send me a letter?’ page.</p>
            <ol><h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3></ol>
            <p>The most common action in the two minute interaction was pressing on the little buttons on the homepage. I was really curious what would’ve happened if I did a specific action like removing all the sections or even sliding the slider. I ended up fiddling with it for a while before realising they don’t do anything and moved to different content. </p>
            <ol><h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3></ol>
            <p>I felt like the primary goal of the website was to keep the user engaged with minimal effort. Because this is a portfolio website, I feel it would be hard to make interactive experiences that would make sense with the webpage. However, these buttons force the user to become curious, hence, which is why they begin fiddling with it. Also when moving onto the ‘Send a letter’ page, there was a lot of flexibility. The drawing tools made it much more fun to create the letter which kept me on the page for a pretty long time.</p>
            <ol><h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3></ol>
            <p>Even though the interactive experience was minimal, it made a huge difference. Without the little buttons and especially the ‘Send the letter’ page, the webpage would’ve lost my attention completely and I would’ve left the page much earlier than I did. As a result, I felt like the little interactions had the primary goal of keeping the user on the page for as long as they can.</p>
            <ol><h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3></ol>
            <p>I felt like overtime I got bored very quickly. There were times when I wanted to click out of the page but my attention was caught by the little buttons. Those really kept my attention because I was so curious what would happen if I used them. The page allowed me to infinitely press the buttons as many times as I wanted, though there was no feedback other than filling in the blank circle/box. However, after entering the ‘Send me a letter’ page, I spent a lot of time fiddling with the page drawing smiley faces and using the drawing tools. I felt like there needed to be some kind of audio or even having the, drawing the letter, feature implemented into the homepage. </p>
            <ol><h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3></ol>
            <p>In terms of the letter page, it is great at being used for a while. Since, the drawing tools are lent to the user, it would mean the creativity of the letter is in the user's hands making them draw for a while before sending a letter.

            <h2> WEEK 2 QUESTIONS</h2>
            <ol><h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3></ol>
            <p>The experience also makes references to social media and other various games that were made.</p>
            <ol><h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3></ol>
            <p>These references suggest that I should take a look at Max Bittker’s social media platforms. Perhaps this is a way to give an insight into Max Bittker’s other work or personal life which would make me want to explore more about him and his website.</p>
            <ol><h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3></ol>
            <p>When engaging with the social media platforms, we are introduced to multiple photos of Matt and other images and works. This is to showcase a bit of his personality, his hobbies and what he likes in his life. This could be a way to portray happiness as it appears that he has an easygoing and adventurous persona. This is somewhat also reflected on the design of the web.</p>
            <ol><h3>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3></ol>
            <p>I felt like the most frustrating element of the interaction was staying focussed on the actual content. Since it is a portfolio website, I wanted to see the work, however, even though the little buttons and interactions kept me for longer, I was actually distracted and instead focussed on the little buttons and drawing on the letter page.</p>
            <ol><h3>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3></ol>
            <p>I felt like the most satisfying element of the interaction was drawing on the letter page. This is because each pen stroke made a noise along with noise that was paired with the text and eraser tool. The feedback made it satisfying and my creativity and curiosity kept me drawing smiley faces on the letter.</p>
